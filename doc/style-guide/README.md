libpandadna Style Guidelines
============================
Code and documentation in the master and release branches of libpandadna must conform to these guidelines. Any code submitted that is not properly formated will be rejected, as it is best to keep a readable, and consistent style for future contributors to read, and understand your code. Don't, however, blindly follow these guidelines into writing unreadable code. Sometimes it is best to use your own judgement.
